This page demonstrates how to manage teams in an organization using a sample project called **ACME Corp**. We will show how to create teams, add members, and grant permissions at a team level.
## Overview of ACME Corp’s Org Structure 
- ACME Corp’s organization chart (shown below as a Mermaid diagram) includes two founders (Frank and Fiona) at the top.  
- Under the founders, there are two main teams: **Products** and **Operations**.  
- The **Products** team is managed by Paul Wood, and it has two sub-teams: **Back End** and **Front End**. Each sub-team has two members.  
- The **Operations** team is managed by Michael, and it has two sub-teams: **DevOps** and **Infrastructure**. Each sub-team has two members.

## Accessing the Members and Teams 

1. Log in to the **Planton-Cloud** console as **Frank** (the founder and owner of the organization).  
2. On the dashboard, you will see a card showing the total number of members. In the demo, there are currently 14 members.

3. Click on **Members** to view all organization members.  
4. Next to **Members**, there is a **Teams** tab, which may be empty if no teams have been created yet.

## Creating a New Team

In this demonstration, we create the **Back End** team. This team includes two existing members, **Bala** and **Bharat**.

1. From the **Teams** tab, click **Create Team** button.  
2. Enter the **Team Name** (“backend”) and a **Description** (“back end team”).  
3. Add members **Bala** and **Bharat**.  
4. Click **Create** to submit the form.

> **Note**: The creator (Frank) is automatically added to the newly created team. This is expected behavior on the platform.
## Viewing the New Team Details

After creation, click the **backend** team name to see:
- **Details**: The team name, description, and creator (Frank).  
- **Roles**: Currently no roles or permissions assigned to the team.  
- **Members**: Bala, Bharat, and Frank (added automatically as the creator).

## Verifying Permissions Before Granting Roles
  Initially, Bala has only the “organization member” role at an individual level. To illustrate how permissions work at the team level:

    1. Log in as **Bala**.  
    2. Attempt to view an existing resource, e.g., **redis-kubernetes**, from the dashboard.  
    3. Notice you see an **“Unauthorized”** error message, indicating Bala does not have permission to view this resource.

To fix Bala’s permission issue, assign a suitable role to the **backend** team:

1. Log back in as **Frank**.  
2. Go to **Teams** → **backend** → **Roles**.  
3. Assign the **“organization viewer”** role to the **backend** team.
Now, everyone in the **backend** team (including Bala and Bharat) gains viewer permissions at the organization level.

## Confirming the Updated Permissions

1. Switch back to **Bala**’s account.  
2. Revisit the **AWS DynamoDB** resource.  
3. This time, Bala can successfully see the resource details without any “Unauthorized” error.

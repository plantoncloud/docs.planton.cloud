In the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications, **Day Two Operations** refer to the ongoing management tasks that occur
after initial deployment. These tasks include monitoring, scaling, updating configurations, troubleshooting, and more.
Efficient Day Two Operations are crucial for maintaining application performance, ensuring reliability, and facilitating
rapid response to issues.

**Planton Cloud** enhances Kubernetes management by integrating essential Day Two Operations directly into its platform.
This write-up provides a comprehensive overview of how Planton Cloud's Kubernetes Day Two Operations empower developers
and DevOps teams to manage their Kubernetes resources more effectively, compared to the open-source **Project Planton**.

## The Importance of Kubernetes Day Two Operations

Kubernetes is a powerful orchestration platform, but its complexity can present challenges in day-to-day management:

- **Operational Complexity**: Managing Kubernetes resources often requires deep knowledge of Kubernetes commands (
  `kubectl`) and manifests.
- **Access Management**: Configuring and distributing Kubernetes credentials securely across teams is non-trivial.
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Developers might need to switch between multiple tools or interfaces to perform operational
  tasks.
- **Time Consumption**: Routine tasks like restarting pods or viewing logs can become time-consuming when not
  streamlined.

## How It Works

### Integration with Deployment Components

- **Deployment Component Store**: Planton Cloud's Deployment Component Store includes Kubernetes resources as deployment
  components (e.g., microservices, databases).
- **Resource Linking**: When a resource is deployed to Kubernetes via Planton Cloud, it is automatically linked to the
  corresponding Kubernetes objects.
- **Visual Indicators**: Resources deployed to Kubernetes display a Kubernetes icon in the UI, indicating that
  Kubernetes operations are available.

### Accessing Kubernetes Operations

1. **Navigate to Resource Details**

    - From the **Catalog on Canvas** or **Resource Explorer**, select the desired Kubernetes resource.
    - Access the resource's detail page, which provides an overview and available actions.

2. **Perform Operations**

    - **View Namespace and Resources**: Click on the Kubernetes icon to explore namespaces and resources.
    - **Edit Manifests**: Open and modify YAML manifests as needed.
    - **Restart Pods**: Use the provided controls to restart pods within the deployment.
    - **View Logs**: Access logs for specific pods or containers.
    - **Execute Commands**: Initiate a `kubectl exec` session directly from the browser.

### Credential and Access Management

- **No Need for Local kubectl Configuration**: Developers do not need to set up `kubectl` or Kubernetes contexts on
  their local machines.
- **Managed Access**: Planton Cloud handles authentication and authorization behind the scenes.
- **Permissions Enforcement**: Users can only perform operations on resources they have been granted access to, as
  defined by the RBAC policies.

## 1. Adding Credentials to the Platform

1. **Navigate to the Connections Page**  
   - On the **Connections** page, you will see a card for **Docker Registry** (or a similarly named card).  
   - This connection type lets you add credentials for various container registries, including Azure Container Registry (ACR).

2. **Locate the Docker Registry Credential Card**  
   - Find the card labeled **Docker Registry**.  
   - This card supports multiple providers (e.g., DockerHub, GCP, AWS ECR, Azure ACR).

3. **Click “Connect”**  
   - Clicking the **Connect** button opens the **Create Docker Registry Credential** form, where you can enter the details for your specific container registry.

4. **Select Azure Container Registry**  
   - In the **Details** section, locate the field **Docker Repo Provider**.  
   - From the dropdown, choose **Azure** (or “Azure ACR,” depending on your platform’s labeling). This will reveal any Azure-specific fields you need to fill in.

5. **Complete the Form & Submit**  
   - Provide the requested information in **Metadata** and **Details** (see below).  
   - Click **Submit** once you have entered all required fields.

### 2.1 Metadata

1. **Name**  
   - **Description**: A user-friendly identifier or nickname for this ChatGPT credential.  
   - **Purpose**: This name helps you recognize and distinguish this credential from others you may have.  
   - **Example**: “Marketing-ChatGPT” or “Internal-QA-ChatGPT”

### 2.2 OpenAI Account

Within the **OpenAI Account** section, you will see the following fields:

1. **API Key**  
   - **Description**: The secret key used to authenticate your API calls to OpenAI.  
   - **Purpose**: Allows the platform to securely communicate with the OpenAI API on your behalf.  
   - **How to Obtain**:  
     1. Log in to your [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/).  
     2. Navigate to **View API keys** under your account settings.  
     3. Click **Create new secret key** and copy the generated key.  
     4. Paste the key into the **API Key** field in the platform’s form.  
   - **Important**: Treat your API Key like a password—never share it publicly or store it in unsecured locations.

2. **API URL**  
   - **Description**: The endpoint URL to which all requests for ChatGPT will be sent.  
   - **Purpose**: Ensures your API calls go to the correct service endpoint (e.g., OpenAI’s default API endpoint, or a custom endpoint if you are using Azure OpenAI).  
   - **Common Example**: `https://api.openai.com/v1`  
   - **How to Obtain**:  
     - If you are using standard OpenAI services, use `https://api.openai.com/v1`.  
     - If you have an Azure OpenAI deployment, retrieve the endpoint from your Azure portal.

3. **Model ID**  
   - **Description**: The identifier of the specific ChatGPT model you want to use.  
   - **Purpose**: Informs the platform which version or variant of OpenAI’s language model to call.  
   - **Common Examples**:  
     - `gpt-3.5-turbo`  
     - `gpt-4` (if you have access)  
   - **How to Obtain**:  
     - From your OpenAI dashboard, review the list of models you have access to.  
     - If using Azure OpenAI, confirm the exact deployment name or model ID in your Azure portal.

## Additional Notes

- **Clarity & Consistency**  
  - Keep your naming conventions and settings uniform across all environments to avoid confusion.
- **Security Best Practices**  
  - Only share or store API credentials in secure, encrypted vaults or within your organization’s approved secret management tool.
- **User-Friendly Terminology**  
  - When documenting for team members, avoid overly technical jargon. Use clear, concise language to help everyone understand how to configure ChatGPT.
- **Provider-Specific Guidelines**  
  - If using providers other than OpenAI (such as Azure), be sure to follow their portal instructions for generating API keys, setting endpoints, and specifying model names.
- **Version Control**  
  - Because OpenAI’s models and endpoints can change over time, periodically review your model IDs and endpoints to keep them up to date.

**That’s it!** Once you’ve completed and submitted this form, your ChatGPT integration should be ready to use in your workflows. Make sure to test your credentials by sending a sample request to confirm everything is working properly. If you encounter any errors, double-check your API key, endpoint, and model ID against the details in your OpenAI or Azure portal.

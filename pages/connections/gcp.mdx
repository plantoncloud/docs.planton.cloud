## 1. Adding Credentials to the Platform

1. **Navigate to the Connections Page**  
   On the **Connections** page, you will see various connection cards, each corresponding to a specific provider (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.).

2. **Locate the GCP Card**  
   Look for the **GCP** connection card in the list.

3. **Click the “Connect” Button**  
   On the GCP card, select **Connect**. This will open a form where you can configure your GCP credentials.

4. **Fill Out the GCP Credentials Form**  
   The form collects the necessary information (detailed below) to authenticate and interact with your GCP resources.

5. **Submit the Form**  
   After entering all required details, click **Submit**. If everything is correctly filled out, your GCP credentials will be securely stored, and the platform will be able to interact with your GCP projects.


## 2. Form Details for GCP Credentials

When the “Connect” button is clicked on the GCP card, you will see a form with two primary sections:

### A. Metadata

  **Purpose**: Provides a clear label for your GCP credential.  
  **Usage**: Helps you identify and distinguish multiple credentials in your workspace (e.g., “GCP Dev Project,”“GCP Prod Project”).

### B. Details
- **Service Account Key (base64)**  

Purpose: This field holds your GCP service account key, encoded in Base64. 

Usage: The platform uses this key to authenticate and access your GCP resources.

GCP Account Key & Links: Generate a service account key in JSON format from the Google Cloud Console, then convert it to Base64.
Documentation: [GCP Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete)

> **Tip**: Some platforms automatically provide a Base64-encoded key upon export, so check the file contents or your GCP portal to confirm whether further encoding is needed.

## Additional Notes

- **Security**: Treat your service account key (Base64-encoded or raw JSON) as confidential. If compromised, unauthorized users can access your GCP resources.  
- **Least Privilege**: Assign only the permissions that your projects and tasks require.  
- **Naming Convention**: Use meaningful names for your credentials—this simplifies management when you have multiple GCP credential sets.  
- **Key Rotation**: Periodically rotate your service account keys to maintain best security practices.  

### Summary

- **Add** new GCP credentials by navigating to **Connections**, selecting **GCP**, and clicking **Connect**.
- **Provide** your credential **Name** and the **Base64-encoded Service Account Key**.
- **Obtain** your service account key JSON from Google Cloud Console and convert it to Base64 if necessary.
- **Keep** credentials secure; rotate keys as recommended in GCP best practices.

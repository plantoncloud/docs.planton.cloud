## 1. Adding a Credential to the Platform

1. **Navigate to Connections**  
   - Go to the **Connections** page in your platform’s user interface.  
   - Here, you’ll see various provider “cards,” each representing a different integration option (e.g., GitHub, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.).

2. **Locate the GitHub Card**  
   - Find the card labeled **GitHub** and click **Connect**.

3. **Open the Credential Form**  
   - A form labeled **Create GitHub Credential** will appear.  
   - This form will prompt you for basic information (metadata) and specific GitHub App details.

## 2. Form Details of the Credential

When creating a GitHub credential, you will see two main sections in the form: **Metadata** and **GitHub App**. Below is an explanation of each field or option:

### 2.1 Metadata

- **Name**  
  - **Purpose**: A friendly name for your GitHub credential. This is how you’ll identify it within the platform.  
  - **How It Appears**: A single text field labeled “Name.”  
  - **Examples**:  
    - `MyOrg-GitHub`  
    - `Production-GitHub-Creds`

> **Tip**: Choose a name that clearly indicates the purpose of the credential (e.g., which organization or repos it will manage).

### 2.2 GitHub App Section

This section handles the actual connection to GitHub via a GitHub App. The screenshot shows two main elements:

1. **Install App Button**  
   - **Purpose**: Clicking this button will redirect you to GitHub, where you can install or configure the **PlantonCloud GitHub App** (or a similarly named app) on your GitHub account or organization.  
   - **Why It Matters**: The GitHub App authorizes the platform to interact with your repositories (e.g., reading code, creating pull requests, triggering workflows).

2. **Already Installed PlantonCloud GitHub App** (Checkbox)  
   - **Purpose**: If you have already installed the GitHub App in your GitHub account or organization, you can select this checkbox.  
   - **Why It Matters**: This lets the platform know you have completed the installation steps, so it does not prompt you to install it again.  
   - **How to Use**:  
     1. If the app is not yet installed, **leave this unchecked** and click **Install App** to complete installation.  
     2. If you have installed it previously, **check the box** and proceed.

#### Required Permissions and API Access

- **Permissions**: The GitHub App needs certain permissions to read or write data (e.g., code, pull requests, webhooks). During app installation, GitHub will display a permissions list.  
- **Repository Access**: You will be asked which repositories this GitHub App can access (all repositories in an organization or specific ones).  
- **How to Obtain/Confirm**:  
  1. From your GitHub account or organization settings, go to **Settings > Applications > Installed GitHub Apps**.  
  2. Locate the **PlantonCloud GitHub App** (or similarly named).  
  3. Click **Configure** to view or update permissions and repository access.

### 2.3 Submitting the Form

Once you have filled out both sections:

1. **Provide a unique Name** in the Metadata section.  
2. **Install** (or confirm installation of) the PlantonCloud GitHub App under the GitHub App section.  
3. Click **Submit**.

> **Note**: The platform may verify your GitHub App installation status automatically. If installation is incomplete or lacking permissions, you could receive an error message indicating that the credential cannot be validated.

## Additional Notes

- **Clarity & Conciseness**  
  - Keep your credential name descriptive yet simple.  
  - Make sure you select only the necessary repositories and permissions when installing the GitHub App to maintain least-privilege access.

- **Consistent Format**  
  - The **Metadata** section is standard across providers (e.g., Name, Description, etc.).  
  - The **GitHub App** section is specific to GitHub, providing the install link and letting you confirm existing installation.

- **User-Friendly Terminology**  
  - “Install App” refers to installing a **GitHub App** on your GitHub account/organization. This is not the same as a local application; it’s a GitHub‐hosted integration that your account must allow.  
  - **PlantonCloud GitHub App** is an example name. Your environment might have a different app name based on your platform’s branding.

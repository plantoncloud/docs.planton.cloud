### 2.2 Azure Account Details

1. **Tenant ID**  
   - **Description**: The directory (tenant) ID for your Azure Active Directory instance.

     3. Copy the **Tenant ID** and paste it here.

2. **Subscription ID**  
   - **Description**: The identifier of the Azure subscription you want to manage or deploy resources into.  
   - **Purpose**: Specifies which subscription your operations and billing will be associated with.  
   - **How to Obtain**:

     2. Locate the subscription you want to use.  
     3. Copy the **Subscription ID** and paste it here.

3. **Client ID**  
   - **Description**: The application (client) ID of the registered Azure app under your Azure Active Directory.

## Additional Notes

- **Security Best Practices**  
  - Always keep your Tenant ID, Subscription ID, Client ID, and Client Secret private.  
  - Use separate credentials for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to minimize risk.  
  - Rotate your Client Secrets regularly to maintain security compliance.

- **Least Privilege Principle**  
  - Configure only the necessary permissions for your Azure AD application. Avoid giving it full admin rights unless absolutely necessary.

- **Testing & Verification**  
  - Once you click **Submit**, use the platform’s functionalities (e.g., provisioning or resource management) to test your Azure credentials.  
  - Confirm that your resources are being created, updated, or listed correctly in Azure.

- **Troubleshooting**  
  - If authentication fails, double-check each field to ensure no typos.  
  - Validate that your Client Secret has not expired if you’ve generated it in the past.  
  - Confirm you have the correct Subscription ID for the environment you intend to manage.

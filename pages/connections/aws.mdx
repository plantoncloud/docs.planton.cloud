## 1. Adding Credentials to the Platform

1. **Navigate to the Connections Page**  
   On the **Connections** page, you will see various connection cards, each corresponding to a specific provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

2. **Locate the AWS Card**  
   Look for the **AWS** connection card in the list.

3. **Click the “Connect” Button**  
   On the AWS card, select **Connect**. This action opens a form where you can configure your AWS credentials.

4. **Fill Out the AWS Credentials Form**  
   The form collects the necessary information to authenticate and interact with your AWS account (detailed below). 

5. **Submit the Form**  
   After entering all required details, click **Submit** to save your credentials. Upon successful completion, the platform will be able to use these credentials to interact with AWS resources.

## 2. Form Details for AWS Credentials

When the “Connect” button is clicked on the AWS card, a form will appear. The form is typically divided into two sections:


![img.png](/images/connections/aws/aws-create-form.png)

### A. Metadata

- **Name**  
  **Purpose**: A user-friendly label for your AWS connection.  
  **Usage**: Helps you distinguish this set of AWS credentials from other connections in your workspace.

### B. AWS Account Details

These fields are specific to AWS and are required to establish a secure connection.

1. **Account ID**  
   **Purpose**: The 12-digit identifier for your AWS account (e.g., `123456789012`).  
   **Usage**: Tells the platform which AWS account it should use when making service calls.  

2. **Default Region**  
   **Purpose**: The primary AWS region you want to use (e.g., `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`).  
   **Usage**: Sets the default region for AWS services accessed via this credential.  
   **How to Obtain**:  
   - Common region codes can be found in the [AWS Regions documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html).  
   - Choose the region closest to your geographic location or most relevant for your project.

3. **Access Key ID**  
   **Purpose**: Your AWS access key used to programmatically sign requests.  
   **Usage**: This key, combined with your secret access key, authorizes the platform to access AWS resources on your behalf.  
   **How to Obtain**:  
   - Log in to your AWS console and navigate to **IAM** → **Users** → (Select your user) → **Security credentials**.  
   - Create or view your **Access Key ID** under **Access Keys**. Remember that AWS only displays the secret key once upon creation.

4. **Secret Access Key**  
   **Purpose**: Your AWS secret access key used to programmatically sign requests (pairs with your Access Key ID).  
   **Usage**: Must be kept confidential—along with your Access Key ID—to prevent unauthorized access to your AWS resources.  
   **How to Obtain**:  
   - When creating a new access key in the AWS IAM console, copy the **Secret Access Key** during the creation process.  
   - AWS will not show this secret again once you navigate away, so store it securely.

## 3. Obtaining AWS Credentials

To obtain your **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, you need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with sufficient permissions. Typically, you would:

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Go to **IAM** (Identity & Access Management).
3. Select **Users** in the navigation pane.
4. Choose an existing user or create a new user with programmatic access.
5. Under **Security Credentials**, create (or retrieve) an **Access Key**.  
   - You will be shown an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.  
   - Store these securely (e.g., in a password manager).

> **Important**: For security best practices, grant the minimal permissions required for the intended tasks and rotate your keys regularly.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Consistency**: Use the **Name** field to clearly identify each credential set (e.g., “AWS Prod,” “AWS Dev,” etc.).
- **Security**: Never share your **Secret Access Key** publicly. If your keys are exposed, rotate them immediately via the AWS Console.
- **Provider-Specific Formats**: The steps above focus specifically on AWS. Other providers (Azure, GCP) will have unique forms and fields on the **Connections** page.

### Summary

- **Add** new credentials by selecting **Connect** in the **Connections** page.
- **Complete** the AWS form fields (Name, Account ID, Default Region, Access Key ID, Secret Access Key).
- **Obtain** credentials from the AWS Console (IAM → Security Credentials).
- **Securely** store your secret key and rotate keys as needed for best security practices.

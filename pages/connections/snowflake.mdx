When you click **Connect** on the Snowflake card, the platform displays a two-section form:

- **Metadata**  
- **Snowflake Account**  

Below is an explanation of each field in these sections.

### 2.1. Metadata Section

| **Field** | **Purpose** | **How to Obtain or Set** |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Name**  | A custom label that identifies this Snowflake connection within your platform. This is how you will refer to or select this connection in other parts of the interface. | Enter any clear and descriptive name, such as *"My Snowflake Data Warehouse"* or *"Marketing Snowflake Connection"*. |

### 2.2. Snowflake Account Section

| **Field**   | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **How to Obtain or Set**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**    | The official Snowflake account name (the part that appears in the URL when you log into Snowflake).                                                                                                                                                   | Typically something like *`xy12345.us-east-2`*. You can find this by logging into your Snowflake instance; it is the portion of your account URL before `.snowflakecomputing.com`.                                                            |
| **Region**  | The region in which your Snowflake account is hosted (e.g., `us-east-2`, `eu-west-1`).                                                                                                                                                                | This is required for specifying where your data warehouse is located. Snowflake indicates the region in your account URL.                                                                                                                   |
| **Username** | The Snowflake user name that has the necessary privileges to access the desired databases, schemas, and tables.                                                                                                                                       | Use a valid Snowflake user with appropriate read/write permissions (or admin privileges if necessary). This information is set up in your Snowflake account via the Snowflake console or your internal IT process.                          |
| **Password** | The password linked to the above Snowflake user.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Make sure to use a secure password or prefer a Snowflake user that supports key-based authentication if available. Enter the correct password to ensure a successful connection.                                                             |

## 3. Obtaining Necessary Credentials from Snowflake

1. **Log in to Snowflake**: Go to your Snowflake console (e.g., `https://xy12345.us-east-2.snowflakecomputing.com`).  
2. **Identify your account name and region**:  
   - The account name is the subdomain portion of your Snowflake URL (e.g., `xy12345.us-east-2`).  
   - The region follows your account name in the URL (e.g., `us-east-2`).  
3. **Create or use an existing user**:  
   - Ensure the user has the appropriate privileges for the tasks you plan to perform (SELECT, CREATE, etc.).  
   - Obtain or reset this user’s password as needed.  

> **Tip:** If you have MFA or single sign-on (SSO) for Snowflake, check whether you need to create a dedicated user account or adjust user settings for programmatic access.

## 4. Saving Your Snowflake Credential

1. **Verify all fields**: Double-check you have entered the correct values for:  
   - Metadata → **Name**  
   - Snowflake Account → **Name**, **Region**, **Username**, **Password**  
2. Click **Submit**.  
3. If the connection is successful, you will see a confirmation message or a newly listed Snowflake credential on the **Connections** page.  

> **Note:** If authentication fails, you may see an error. Verify the details (especially the user name, password, and account name) and try again.

---

## 5. Additional Notes and Best Practices

- **Security**: Always store credentials securely and avoid sharing passwords in plain text.  
- **Naming Conventions**: Use a name that clearly indicates the environment or purpose (e.g., *Snowflake_Prod* or *Snowflake_Test*).  
- **User Permissions**: Grant only the minimum required privileges to the Snowflake user used for connections (adhering to the principle of least privilege).  
- **Region Selection**: Ensure you choose the correct region to avoid connection failures and to comply with any data locality requirements.

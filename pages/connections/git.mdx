## 1. Adding Credentials to the Platform

1. **Navigate to the Connections Page**  
   - On the **Connections** page, you will see a set of connection cards for various providers.

2. **Locate the Git Credential Card**  
   - Look for the card labeled **Git** (or “Git Credential”).  
   - This card represents the connection you need to configure for accessing Git repositories.

3. **Click “Connect”**  
   - Clicking the **Connect** button on the card will open a form requesting specific details (described below).

4. **Fill Out the Git Credential Form**  
   - Provide the required information as outlined in the **Form Details** section.  
   - Once all fields have been completed, click **Submit** to save your Git credential.

## 2. Form Details of the Credential

When you open the **Create Git Credential** form (as shown in the screenshot), there are two main sections: **Metadata** and **Details**.

### 2.1 Metadata

1. **Name**  
   - **Description**: A user-friendly identifier or nickname for this Git credential.  
   - **Purpose**: Helps you distinguish this credential from others in your environment.  
   - **Example**: “GitHub-Deploy-Key” or “Bitbucket-Repo-Credential”

### 2.2 Details

Within the **Details** section, you can configure any combination of the following credentials. Depending on your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), you may only need one or two of these fields filled in.

1. **SSH Private Key**  
   - **Description**: The private key used for SSH-based Git authentication.  
   - **Purpose**: Grants secure access to Git repositories via SSH.  
   - **How to Obtain**:  
     1. Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine or via your Git provider’s instructions (often through `ssh-keygen` on Linux/Mac or PuTTYgen on Windows).  
     2. Copy the **private** key contents (the file often named `id_rsa` or similar) and paste them into this field.  
     3. Add the **public** key (often `id_rsa.pub`) to your Git provider’s repository or account settings under “SSH Keys.”

2. **Password**  
   - **Description**: The password associated with your Git user account.  
   - **Purpose**: Enables Basic authentication with Git if SSH keys or tokens are not used.  
   - **How to Obtain**:  
     - Use your existing account password.  
     - If your provider has 2FA enabled or discourages password usage, consider using a Personal Access Token instead.

3. **Personal Access Token**  
   - **Description**: A token created in your Git provider’s portal to grant scoped permissions (e.g., read or write access) to repositories.  
   - **Purpose**: More secure than a password and can be set to expire or have limited access.  
   - **How to Obtain**:  
     1. Log in to your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).  
     2. Navigate to your **Settings** or **Profile** and locate **Developer settings** or **Personal Access Tokens**.  
     3. Create a new token with the required scopes (e.g., `repo` for GitHub).  
     4. Copy the token and paste it here.  
     5. Important: Tokens are often shown only once, so store them in a secure location if needed again.

4. **Username**  
   - **Description**: Your Git user account name or handle.  
   - **Purpose**: Required for certain types of authentication or when using Personal Access Tokens or passwords (e.g., `git clone https://username@github.com/...`).  
   - **How to Obtain**:  
     - Usually the same username you use to log in to your Git provider.

## Additional Notes

- **Security Best Practices**  
  - Treat all credentials (SSH keys, passwords, tokens) like sensitive information.  
  - Store them securely and rotate them periodically.  
  - Never share your private key or tokens publicly.

- **Provider-Specific Guidelines**  
  - Each Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) may have slightly different instructions for generating SSH keys or Personal Access Tokens. Always consult their official documentation if you have doubts.

- **Clarity & Consistency**  
  - Use consistent naming conventions for your credentials (e.g., “GitHub-Personal-Token-ReadWrite”). This makes it easier to manage multiple credentials over time.

- **Testing & Validation**  
  - After you click **Submit**, try cloning or pushing to a test repository from within your environment to verify that the credential works as expected.

- **Troubleshooting**  
  - If you encounter authentication errors, double-check that your SSH public key is correctly added to your Git account or that your Personal Access Token has the necessary permissions.  
  - Confirm your Username matches the credentials or token’s owner.

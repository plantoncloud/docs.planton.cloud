## Project Planton: An Overview

**Project Planton** is an open-source framework aimed at providing a consistent and simplified deployment experience
across various cloud providers and platforms like Kubernetes. It achieves this through a combination of standardized
APIs, default Pulumi modules, and a command-line interface (CLI) that ties everything together.

### Key Components of Project Planton

1. **MURM APIs (Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model APIs)**:
    - Based on the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM), MURM APIs provide a standardized way to define and manage resources
      across different cloud providers.
    - These APIs are defined using Protocol Buffers (protobuf), ensuring strong typing, validation, and consistency.
    - They form the backbone of Project Planton, enabling a unified approach to resource configuration.

2. **Default Pulumi Modules**:
    - For each deployment component (e.g., Redis on Kubernetes, GCS Bucket), there is a corresponding default Pulumi
      module.
    - These modules are pre-written and maintained, encapsulating best practices and the necessary logic to deploy
      resources on specific cloud providers.
    - They save developers from the need to write their own infrastructure code from scratch.

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
    - The CLI acts as the glue between the MURM APIs and the Pulumi modules.
    - It understands the APIs, validates configuration manifests, and sets up the necessary inputs for the Pulumi
      modules.
    - It knows how to download and utilize the default modules, and allows for customization by specifying custom
      modules.

### Benefits of Project Planton

- **Consistent Deployment Experience**:
    - Provides a unified method for deploying resources across different cloud providers and platforms.
    - Reduces the learning curve for developers, as they can use the same approach regardless of the target environment.

- **Simplification of Complex Deployments**:
    - Abstracts away the intricate details of each cloud provider's deployment processes.
    - Developers can focus on defining what they want to deploy, rather than how to deploy it.

- **Open-Source and Customizable**:
    - Being open-source, it encourages community contributions and transparency.
    - Developers and DevOps engineers can fork and customize the default modules to suit specific needs.

- **Validation and Error Handling**:
    - The use of protobuf for API definitions allows for robust validation.
    - Errors and validation messages are clear, helping developers catch issues early.

### Limitations of Project Planton

- **No UI Dashboard**:
    - Relies solely on YAML manifests and the CLI.
    - May not be ideal for organizations or developers who prefer a graphical interface.

- **No Integrated CI/CD Pipelines**:
    - Requires setting up separate CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate deployments.
    - Additional overhead for DevOps teams to maintain these pipelines.

- **Lack of Centralized Resource Management**:
    - Does not provide a centralized view or management of deployed resources.
    - Teams may need to navigate multiple repositories or systems to track deployments.

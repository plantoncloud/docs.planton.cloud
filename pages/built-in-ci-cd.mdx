In the realm of cloud infrastructure management, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for automating the deployment and management of infrastructure resources. **Planton Cloud** introduces a revolutionary approach to CI/CD pipelines by providing **built-in, zero-configuration Infrastructure as Code (IaC) CI/CD pipelines**, known as **Stack Jobs**. This write-up delves into the intricacies of these pipelines, their value proposition, and how they differentiate Planton Cloud from the open-source **Project Planton**.

## The Need for Integrated CI/CD Pipelines

Traditionally, setting up CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure deployments involves:

- **Manual Configuration**: Developers or DevOps engineers must set up pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Pipelines require ongoing maintenance to handle updates, dependencies, and integration with various tools.
- **Complexity**: Managing pipelines across multiple cloud providers and environments increases complexity and potential for errors.
- **Lack of Visibility**: Separate tools for CI/CD and infrastructure management can lead to fragmented visibility and control.

## Planton Cloud's Solution: Built-In Zero-Config IaC CI/CD Pipelines

### What Are Stack Jobs?

**Stack Jobs** are the core of Planton Cloud's built-in CI/CD system. They are automated pipelines that manage the lifecycle of infrastructure deployments using Pulumi under the hood.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Zero-Configuration**: No need for users to set up or configure pipelines manually.
- **Lifecycle Integration**: Tied directly to resource lifecycle events—creation, updates, and deletion.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides live progress updates and logs within the Planton Cloud UI.
- **Pulumi-Powered**: Leverages Pulumi to manage infrastructure, offering the same detailed insights and diffs.

### How It Works

1. **Resource Deployment**:
   - When a developer **creates** a new resource using the Planton Cloud UI, a Stack Job is automatically triggered to **deploy** the resource.
   - The Stack Job runs `pulumi up` to provision the infrastructure.

2. **Resource Updates**:
   - If a developer **updates** the configuration of an existing resource (e.g., changing CPU allocation), a Stack Job is triggered to **apply** the changes.
   - The Stack Job runs `pulumi preview` to show the potential changes and `pulumi up` to apply them.

3. **Resource Deletion**:
   - When a resource is **deleted**, a Stack Job runs `pulumi destroy` to clean up the infrastructure.

4. **Lifecycle Events and Automation**:
   - Stack Jobs are tied to these lifecycle events, ensuring that infrastructure state always matches the desired configuration.

### Live Progress and Logging

- **Real-Time Updates**: Developers can monitor the progress of deployments in real-time within the Planton Cloud dashboard.
- **Detailed Logs**: Access to logs and outputs from Pulumi, providing transparency and aiding in troubleshooting.

### Stack Job Settings

Developers have control over certain aspects of Stack Jobs:

- **Pulumi Module Selection**: Choose which Pulumi module to use for deployment—default or custom modules from the Pulumi Module Registry.
- **Stack Job Runner Selection**: Specify where the Stack Job should run (more on this below).
- **Approval Workflows**:
  - **Manual Approvals**: Configure Stack Jobs to require manual approval before applying changes or destroying resources.
  - **Automatic Execution**: Allow Stack Jobs to run without manual intervention for faster deployments.

### Stack Job Runners

**Stack Job Runners** are the execution environments where Stack Jobs run.

- **Default Runners**: Planton Cloud provides default Stack Job Runners managed by the platform.
- **Custom Runners**:
  - **Bring Your Own Infrastructure**: Organizations can deploy Stack Job Runners within their own infrastructure (e.g., on-premises, within their cloud accounts).
  - **Compliance and Security**: Running Stack Jobs on custom runners helps meet compliance requirements and ensures sensitive operations stay within controlled environments.
  - **Deployment Component**: The Stack Job Runner itself is a deployment component available in the Deployment Component Store, making it easy to deploy and manage.

## Comparison with Project Planton

### Project Planton’s Approach

- **Manual CI/CD Setup**: Developers using Project Planton need to set up their own CI/CD pipelines, typically using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **CLI-Based Deployments**: Developers might execute `pulumi` commands manually or script them within their CI/CD tools.
- **Overhead and Complexity**: Setting up and maintaining these pipelines adds complexity and requires additional expertise.

### Limitations in Project Planton

- **No Integrated CI/CD**: Lacks built-in pipelines tied to resource lifecycle events.
- **Fragmented Experience**: Developers switch between tools (CLI, CI/CD platforms) and manage configurations separately.
- **Visibility Challenges**: Monitoring deployment progress and logs is not centralized.

### Advantages of Planton Cloud’s Built-In CI/CD

1. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Planton Cloud unifies the deployment process within a single platform.
   - Reduces context switching and streamlines workflows.

2. **Time Savings**:

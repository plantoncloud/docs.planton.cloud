## What is the Pulumi Module Registry?

The **Pulumi Module Registry** in Planton Cloud is a centralized repository where you can:

- **Explore** existing Pulumi modules (infrastructure code) available for deploying resources.
- **Register** custom Pulumi modules developed within your organization.
- **Manage** and **select** Pulumi modules during resource deployments.

Pulumi modules are reusable components that define how infrastructure resources are provisioned and configured on
various cloud providers. In Planton Cloud, the registry serves as a bridge between your deployment configurations and
the underlying infrastructure code.

## Registering Custom Pulumi Modules

Platform engineers or DevOps teams may need to create custom Pulumi modules to meet specific infrastructure
requirements.

### Steps to Register a Custom Module

1. **Develop the Pulumi Module**:
   -Write** the Pulumi code in your preferred programming language supported by Pulumi (e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go).
    - **Test** the module to ensure it works as expected.
    - **Version Control**: Commit the code to a version control system like GitHub.

2. **Prepare for Registration**:
    - Ensure the repository is accessible (public or private with appropriate access).
    - Gather necessary information (repository URL, authentication details if private).

3. **Register the Module in Planton Cloud**:
    - **Access the Pulumi Module Registry**.
    - **Click on "Register New Module"** or similar action button.
    - **Fill in Module Details**:
        - **Name**: Provide a unique and descriptive name.
        - **Description**: Explain what the module does.
        - **Version**: Specify the version (e.g., v1.0.0).
        - **Repository URL**: Enter the URL to the GitHub repository.
        - **Authentication**:
            - If the repository is private, provide authentication details.
            - Options may include SSH keys, personal access tokens, or OAuth tokens.
        - **Tags/Categories**: Add relevant tags to aid in searching.
    - **Submit** the form to complete registration.

4. **Verification**:
    - Planton Cloud may perform a verification process to ensure the module is accessible and valid.
    - You may receive notifications if there are issues that need to be resolved.

### Managing Custom Modules

- **Update Modules**: When updating the module, ensure you update the version and re-register or update the existing
  registration in Planton Cloud.
- **Deprecation**: If a module is no longer needed, you can deprecate or remove it from the registry.
- **Documentation**: Keep module documentation well-documented to aid other users in understanding and using them.

## Using Pulumi Modules in Deployments

When deploying resources in Planton Cloud, you can select which Pulumi module to use for the deployment.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Initiate a Deployment**:
    - From the **Deployment Component Store**, choose the resource you wish to deploy (e.g., AWS S3 Bucket, GCP GCS
      Bucket).
    - Click on **"Deploy"** or **"Create"**.

2. **Configure Deployment Settings**:
    - **Fill in Resource Details**: Provide necessary configuration parameters for the resource.
    - **Select Environment**: Choose the environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

3. **Stack Job Settings**:
   -Locate** the **"Stack Job Settings"** section in the deployment form form.
    - **Pulumi Module Selection**:
        - **Default Option**: If you leave this blank, Planton Cloud will use the default module associated with the
          resource.
        - **Custom Module**: Click on the dropdown to select a custom Pulumi module from the registry.
        - **Search Modules**: If you have many modules, use the search functionality to find the desired one.

4. **Complete Deployment**:
    - **Review Configuration**: Ensure all settings are correct.
    - **Deploy**: Click on **"Deploy"** or **"Create"** to initiate the deployment.
    - **Stack Job Execution**: Planton Cloud will trigger a stack job that uses the selected Pulumi module to deploy the
      resource.

### Considerations

- **Compatibility**:Ensure** that the Pulumi module you select are compatible with the resource and configuration you
  you're deploying.
- **Permissions**:You** must have access to the Pulumi module, especially if it's a private repository.
  -Communication**: If you're unsure which module to use, consult with your platform engineering team.

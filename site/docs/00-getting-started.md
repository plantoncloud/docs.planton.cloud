# The One NoOps Platform

Team at Planton Cloud believes that IT Operations is not a problem that every company needs to solve.

## NoOps vs DevOps

NoOps (short for "no operations") and DevOps (short for "development operations") are two different approaches to
software development and deployment. NoOps is a philosophy that advocates for removing the need for dedicated operations
teams in software development and deployment, while DevOps is a set of practices and tools that aim to improve
collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.

### Advantages of using NoOps over DevOps

**Faster deployment and iteration:** By removing the need for dedicated operations teams, NoOps can help to speed up the
deployment and iteration of new software and features. This can be especially useful for organizations that need to
quickly release new updates and innovations to stay competitive.

**Simplified management and maintenance:** Without the need for operations teams, NoOps can help to reduce the
complexity
and overhead of managing software deployments. This can make it easier for development teams to focus on writing and
testing code, rather than worrying about the operational aspects of deployment.

**Improved collaboration and coordination:** By automating many of the tasks that are typically handled by operations
teams,
NoOps can help to improve collaboration and coordination between different teams within an organization. This can lead
to better alignment and more efficient workflows, which can help to accelerate software development and deployment.

## Developers

Team at Planton Cloud believes that the developers enjoy creating software. However, because of the lack of matured
developer productivity tools, developers find themselves dealing with other aspects of the software development like
setting up building and operating build and deployment pipelines. This shift in focus leads to a lot of frustration
which reduces the velocity with which the developers contribute more features to the product which are essential for the
success of a company.

Development Team can take advantage of the below list of features offered by Planton Cloud to ensure that their focus
remains on adding features or fixing bugs.

* Create new Microservices from templates
* Get CI/CD for any type of code project out of the box
* Get visibility into the services once they are deployed to hosting environments
* Get access to a build engine that gives them superpowers while developing on their laptop

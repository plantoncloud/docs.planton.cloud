# DNS Domains

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources
connected to the internet or a private network. A DNS domain is a unique identifier for a group of devices, computers,
or servers that are connected to the internet. Each domain is associated with an IP address that enables devices to
communicate with one another. Managing DNS domains is an important aspect of managing your infrastructure, as it enables
you to control the domain names used for your websites, applications, and other online services.

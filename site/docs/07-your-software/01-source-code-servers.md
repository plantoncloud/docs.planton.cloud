# Source Code Servers

A source code server is a central location where the source code for a company's software applications is stored and
managed. It provides developers with a single location to access, modify, and share their source code, while also
providing version control and collaboration tools to manage changes to the code.

A source code server can be hosted on-premise or in the cloud, and can support various source control systems, such as
Git or SVN. It provides developers with a structured and organized approach to managing their code, while also enabling
them to easily collaborate with other team members.

In the context of Planton Cloud, connecting your source code server to the platform enables you to easily create new
source code projects from provided templates, and also enables you to configure CI/CD pipelines for those projects. This
provides a streamlined and efficient approach to developing and deploying software applications in a cloud-based
environment.

## GitHub

To connect a GitHub organization to Planton Cloud Console, you will grant Planton Cloud Console permission to access
your GitHub organization's repositories.

1. Go to the Planton Cloud Console dashboard and select "Connect Source Code Server".
2. Select "GitHub" as the source code server type.
3. Click "Install" to install the GitHub app in Planton Cloud Console.

Once you have granted access to the GitHub organization repositories, you can use them in Planton Cloud Console. Follow
these steps to use a GitHub repository:

1. Go to the Planton Cloud Console dashboard and select "Source Code Projects".
2. Click on the GitHub repository you want to use.
3. Create a new microservice or use an existing microservice to deploy the code from the repository.

By following these steps, you can easily connect your GitHub organization to Planton Cloud Console and use your GitHub
repositories in your microservices.

## GitLab

To connect a GitLab group to Planton Cloud Console, you will need to use a GitLab app that has been created in the
GitLab group. The GitLab app will allow you to grant Planton Cloud Console permission to access your GitLab group's
repositories.

1. Go to the Planton Cloud Console dashboard and select "Connect Source Code Server".
2. Select "GitLab" as the source code server type.
3. Click "Install" to install the GitLab app in Planton Cloud Console

Once you have granted access to the GitLab group repositories, you can use them in Planton Cloud Console. Follow these
steps to use a GitLab repository:

1. Go to the Planton Cloud Console dashboard and select "Source Code Projects".
2. Click on the GitLab repository you want to use.
3. Create a new microservice or use an existing microservice to deploy the code from the repository.

By following these steps, you can easily connect your GitLab group to Planton Cloud Console and use your GitLab
repositories in your microservices.
